the Maze runner Game with SDL2

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Overview

This document outlines the creation of a basic maze game using the SDL2 library. 
It focuses on core functionalities for a playable experience and serves as a starting point for further development.

Maze Representation

 A 2D character array represents the maze layout.
  * '#' denotes a wall.
  * ' ' indicates an empty space (floor).

Player and Camera

* Player position is tracked using x and y coordinates (float).
* Viewing direction is defined by angles (float) for player orientation.

Game Loop

1. Initialization:
    * Include necessary libraries (SDL2).
    * Define screen dimensions.
    * Initialize SDL and create a window.
2. Main Loop:
    * Handle user input for movement (forward, backward, turn).
    * Update player position and viewing direction based on input.
    * Clear the screen.
    * Draw the maze.
    * Update the display.
3. Cleanup:
    * Close SDL on exit.

Drawing the Maze

* Iterate through the maze array.
* If a cell contains '#', draw a rectangle representing a wall using SDL functions.
  * Adjust rectangle size and color for visual customization.

User Input

* Capture user input (arrow keys/WASD) to control player movement.
* Update player direction and position within maze boundaries.
* Implement logic to prevent player movement through walls (collision detection - not covered in MVP).

Expanding the MVP

* Collision Detection: Prevent player movement through walls.
* Ray Casting: Implement ray casting for a more realistic perspective.
* Textures:Enhance visuals by adding textures to walls and floors.
* Lighting Effects:Improve immersion with basic lighting effects.
* Menus: Create menus for new game, load/save, and quit functionality.
* Difficulty Levels:Offer different maze sizes and complexity levels.
* Exit Detection:Implement logic to detect when the player reaches the exit. 
* Scoring (Optional):Track time taken or items collected (optional).


This documentation provides a roadmap for building a maze game with SDL2. By implementing the outlined features, to create a foundational maze game and expand upon it to create a more immersive and engaging experience.
